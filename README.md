# printf()
This is an Alx Software Engineering printf project by **Millicent Amegavie** and **Afia Serwaa Ntosour-Amponsem**, students of the ALX SE Programme. In this project, we use the "_printf" function which imitates the "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This README borrows from the Linux man page printf(3). 

_printf() is a function that writes output to standard output. the prototype for the function is:

	int _printf(const char *format, ...)

After a successful return, the "_printf()" returns the amount of characters printed. Otherwise, if an error is returned, the function returns a different output.
